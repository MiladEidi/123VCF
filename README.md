# 123VCF

123VCF has been developed to make the filtration step of VCF files more reliable and efficient.
It can be used in the most important step of whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing data analysis in the research and also clinical settings.
It just gets the filtration order file and variant file and then, it filters variants based on what you ordered through the filtration order file.

# Features

Graphical user interface

Easy-to use

Easy-to-understand

Compressed or non-compressed VCF files as input

Survived variants present in VCF format and Tab-separated format

123VCF puts the same BED feature variants when the user define a BED filter next to each other in a TSV file to detect possible compound heterozygous variants
